# S3DL (Simple 3D Library) - Simple C++ Vulkan wrapper

S3DL is a very simple Vulkan wrapper I started to make during an internship.
Its goal is to wrap most of Vulkan's concepts into classes that allow to manipulate them easily but without taking control on the pipeline away from the user.

The interface of this library is far from definitive but due to my studies, I have no time to continue it for the moment.
