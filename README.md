# S3DL (Simple 3D Library) - Simple C++ Vulkan wrapper

S3DL is a very simple Vulkan wrapper I started to make during an internship.
Its goal is to wrap most of Vulkan's concepts into classes that allow to manipulate them easily but without taking control on the pipeline away from the user.

Though this library is functionnal for most basic uses, it was meant to be much more powerful than that. However, due to lack of time to develop such a library using Vulkan and for many other reasons, I decided to restart [this project from zero using OpenGL instead](https://github.com/Reiex/SplayLibrary). However I do not abandon Vulkan and this project might revive in the future.
